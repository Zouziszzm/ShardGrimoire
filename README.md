## Mobile Development Projects

This repository contains all the projects from the **Mobile Development** branch, focused on building applications for **mobile devices**. It includes various projects developed using **React Native**, **Flutter**, and **Electron**, showcasing my work with **cross-platform** and **native mobile applications**.

- **React Native**: Native mobile apps built with React Native for both iOS and Android platforms.
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform apps developed with Flutter, providing a rich mobile UI and high performance.
- **Electron**: Apps focused on building desktop applications using web technologies, with hybrid mobile solutions possible.

This repository will continue to grow as I explore new techniques and technologies in mobile app development.

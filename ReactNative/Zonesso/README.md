## 🖍 Submission Note
This project has been submitted as part of the Zonesso Assessment, with a deadline of 9th January 2025. I have utilized Context API for state management and Expo for navigation. I have tried my best to adhere to industry standards, but if any mistakes or shortcomings are found, I apologize in advance. If given the opportunity, I will address these issues and make improvements.

## 🚀 Task Overview

### Frontend (React Native):
- **Home Screen:** Displays car wash categories, top showrooms, and promotions.
- **Service Listing:** Lists car wash services based on location (e.g., Dubai, Sharjah).
- **Service Details:** Includes:
  - Service price and description.
  - Contact details.
  - "Chat" and "Call" buttons (UI only, no functionality).
- **Company Profile:** Displays company info and available services.
- **Booking Screen:** Form to select date, time, location, and vehicle details.
- **Payment Screen:** Displays a summary and a "Payment Confirmation" button.

### Backend (Node.js using NestJS):
- **API Endpoints:**
  - Fetch categories and services by location.
  - Retrieve service details.
  - Store user bookings (service, date, time, location, vehicle).
  - Mock payment handling (no real payment processing).

### Database (MongoDB):
- Stores categories, services, bookings, and payment details.
